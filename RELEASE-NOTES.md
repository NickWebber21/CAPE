## Release Notes

### Style Updates

#### Navbar

In addition to the original Home, About, and Help pages, the Sign In, Sign Up,
and Sign Out buttons are now positioned in the navbar.

A second navbar was added to allow for easy navigation between the Presentations,
Evaluations, and Roster pages.

#### Content Boxes

All instances of information that is shown to the user have been placed into bordered boxes or buttons. This allows the user to see
bite-sized pieces of information that they can easily distinguish from other pieces of information. In the proper places, colored buttons
have also been placed alongside content to make navigation easier.

### Content

#### Home Page Content

The Home page has been reorganized to more effectively display information. The title has been condensed to a single line,
while the account settings page has been placed in a welcome message that users can easily access. A user can also easily
see the class they are enrolled in.

Multiple headers have been added to describe useful information in one area.

#### Content Filtering

On most pages that display useful information to the user, the relevant information (Presentations, Evaluations, Rosters) has been
filtered into different categories so that content is easier to digest. For example, on the Home page, Presentations are split
into sections of your own Presentations and other users' Presentations. On the Evaluations page, a user can easily see both Evaluations
on their work and the Evaluations that they wrote.

#### Expansion of Evaluation Details

The full-length labels for the evaluation questions, intially only shown on the Evaluation form, are now visible in a full table
that can be easily digested by a user.

### CanCanCan

#### Evaluations

The authorization permissions on Evaluations were changed to ensure that a user can see all of the Evaluations relevent to them -
the Evaluations they wrote and the evaluations that are on their presentation. Instructors can see all Evaluations.

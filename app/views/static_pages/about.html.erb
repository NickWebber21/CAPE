<h1>About</h1>
<p>
    This is the CAPE project (Comprehensive Assessment of Presentation Effectiveness). This tool is a web application meant for streamlining the process of peer and self evaluation of presentations. 
    It is meant to be used by students and teachers alike. The application allows instructors to create presentations and then share them with students.
    The peers can then evaluate the presentation based on a set of criteria. The application then aggregates the evaluations and presents them to the presenter. 
    The presenter can then use this information to improve their presentation skills. The application also allows teachers to create classes and invite students to them. 
    The teachers can then view the presentations and evaluations of the students in their class. 
    The application is meant to be used by students and teachers alike to improve the presentation skills of students.
